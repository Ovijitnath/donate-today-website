            <p>The flood inundation has submerged houses, wells, latrines and agricultural lands disrupting basic
                services and forcing families to seek shelter. Thousands of families are facing severe shortage of food,
                drinking water and sanitation which can result in outbreak of widespread waterborne diseases. Children
                are also highly vulnerable to snake bites and drowning in such situation.</p><br><br>

                <h3>Food for a family</h3>
                <p>Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado,
                    flood, hurricane or blizzard. Bangladeshi families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit from
                    being prepared in the event of disaster. Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the
                    immediate few days after the disaster can reduce stress, worry and inconvenience.</p>

                <p>Emergency shelters or transitional shelters are a common issue in the aftermath of disasters.
                    Worldwide, millions of houses are damaged or destroyed by disasters every year. People are forced to
                    leave their homes and seek refuge, sometimes for short time and sometimes for a protracted period
                    based on the nature of the disaster and the extent of the damage done to the housing structures.</p>
